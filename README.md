## Overview of the project 

In this Challenge, I was task to  complete the code that enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, we assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

To complete this Challenge, I am using two Python files:
1. [fintech_finder.py]()  contains the code associated with the web interface of the application. The code included in this file is compatible with the Streamlit library. 

2. [crypto_wallet.py]() contains the Ethereum transaction functions. By using import statements, I integrate the crypto_wallet.py Python script into the Fintech Finder interface program that is found in the fintech_finder.py file. 


Integrating these two files allow the user to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via Ethereumâ€™s Kovan testnet.

## Project goals

1. Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase (which you created earlier in the module).

2. Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

3. Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

4. Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Kovan testnet.

5. Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

6. Once you receive the transactionâ€™s hash code, you will navigate to Kovanâ€™s Etherscan (Links to an external site.) website to review the blockchain transaction details 


## Project steps

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

### Step 1: Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application

##### Import generate_account, get_balance, and send_transaction from the crypto_wallet.py file.

##### Call the generate_account function and store the account object.

### Step 2: Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction

##### Calculate the transactionâ€™s total wage.

##### Call the send_transaction function and pass it the account, candidate_address, and wage parameters.

##### Return the transaction hash from the send_transaction and display it on the applicationâ€™s web interface.

### Step 3: Inspect the Transaction on Etherscan

##### Send a transaction using the Fintech Finder app

##### Use the returned transaction hash to verify the transaction on Etherscan.

##### Provide screenshots from Etherscan that show the senderâ€™s address balance and history, and the recipient's address balance and history. 

            ##### Sender

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, List

```

* Streamlit- is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.
* Dataclasses-a utility tool to make structured classes specially for storing data. These classes hold certain properties and functions to deal specifically with the data and its representation.
* Typing-provides runtime support for type hints. The most fundamental support consists of the types Any, Union, Tuple, Callable, TypeVar, and Generic.
